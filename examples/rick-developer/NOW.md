# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Week 10, Jan 6
- Pattern shift: Sending more applications (12 this week vs 3/week average before)
- Quality dropped slightly but volume is working - got 2 interviews this week
- Quote: *"I was perfecting applications to avoid rejection. Just needed to send more."*
- Side project temptation still there but staying disciplined in JOB SEARCH mode

### Week 9, Dec 30
- Holiday slowdown in responses, used time for interview prep
- Practiced system design problems, feeling more confident
- Reached out to 2 former colleagues - both responded positively
- Pattern: Networking feels uncomfortable but has 100% response rate vs 5% for cold apps

### Week 8, Dec 23
- Breakthrough week: Realized he's been spending 2 hours per application
- Math didn't work: 2hrs × 7 days = 7 applications/week = 28/month = low odds
- Shifted to 30min per application, 3-5 per day target
- First time prioritizing quantity over perfect applications

### Week 6, Dec 9
- Still in SIDE PROJECT mode more than JOB SEARCH
- When asked directly: *"I'm using building as excuse to avoid job search"*
- Agreed to force JOB SEARCH mode for 2 weeks minimum
- Set rule: No side project until 5 applications sent that day

### Week 4, Nov 25
- Got first interview callback - Google recruiter screen
- Imposter syndrome kicked in hard after layoff mention
- Didn't advance - technical screen weak on system design
- Quote: *"The layoff made me doubt everything I know"*

### Week 2, Nov 11
- Applications: 15 sent, 1 response
- Pattern: Avoiding networking because it feels like begging
- Truth: *"Applying feels like begging too, but networking actually works"*

### Week 1, Nov 4
- Setup complete. Mission: Land $80K+ offer by Jan 31
- 3 months runway, need income soon
- Known bugs: Perfectionism on apps, avoiding networking, side project escape, imposter syndrome
- Target: 5 applications/day minimum

*Mode at end of day: JOB SEARCH*
