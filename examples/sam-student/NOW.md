# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Week 12, Jan 9
- Broke through tutorial hell: 8 day code streak (personal record)
- First project idea solidified: Budget tracker CLI app
- Quote: *"I don't need to finish the course to start building"*
- Shift happening: Learning by building instead of building after learning

### Week 10, Dec 26
- Holiday break from retail job = more coding time
- Completed 10 days of course content in 5 days
- Energy observation: Morning coding (6-8am) before work is most productive
- Pattern: Tutorial watching in evening = low retention

### Week 9, Dec 19
- Caught in tutorial comparison: Saw someone's portfolio who started at same time, felt behind
- Reality check: They're full-time, Sam is part-time + retail job
- Quote: *"Watching tutorials feels like progress but it's not. Only building is."*
- Decision: No new courses, finish this one

### Week 7, Dec 5
- Enrolled in second Python course "to learn better"
- Tutorial hell pattern emerging - called out on it
- Defensive at first, then: *"I'm scared to build because it might be bad"*
- Agreed to finish Day 50 then start building, no new courses

### Week 5, Nov 21
- First "aha moment": Built a working calculator without looking at solution
- Took 3 hours, lots of errors, but figured it out
- Quote: *"This felt way better than watching someone else code"*
- Energy shift: Excited instead of overwhelmed

### Week 3, Nov 7
- Perfectionism showing up: Won't move to next lesson until current one is "mastered"
- Spending 2 days per lesson instead of 1
- Math problem: At this rate, 100 days = 200 days = course done in July (too slow)
- Agreed to "good enough" = move forward if can reproduce 80% without help

### Week 1, Oct 26
- Setup complete. Mission: Python by Jan 31, 3 projects by Mar 15
- Working retail 20hrs/week, 2-3 hours daily for coding
- Course: 100 Days of Python (Day 12/100)
- Known bugs: Tutorial hell, perfectionism, overwhelm, comparison
- Core fear: *"Not being smart enough for tech"*

*Mode at end of day: LEARNING*
