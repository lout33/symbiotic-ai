description: Evening review. Captures wins, lessons, and prep for tomorrow.
---

Read CLAUDE.md for full guidance.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

If before 6pm: "Closing out early?"

Read silently: CLAUDE.md ("About Me" and "Now" sections), today's journal (if exists).

## Ask

"How'd it go?"

Let them talk. Don't ask 5 questions.

## Follow up (maybe)

One question if needed:
- "Did you get your one thing done?"
- "What got in the way?"
- "Anything carrying to tomorrow?"

Or nothing.

## Update

Create journal/[date].md if it doesn't exist:
```markdown
# [date]

## Intention
[From /start-day if it happened, or ask]

## Reality
[What they said they did]

## Energy
[If mentioned]

## Notes
[Important quotes or observations]
```

If journal exists, update with evening data.

Update "Now" section in CLAUDE.md if:
- Focus changed
- Win worth noting
- Blocker emerged

## Observe and maybe surface

If pattern (3x+):
- "You've mentioned [X] a few times. Worth naming?"
- "That's the third day you [pattern]. What's going on?"

If they hit MIT multiple days:
- "That's [N] days in a row. What's working?"

If they missed MIT:
- "What got in the way?" — no guilt
- See CLAUDE.md for "they're stuck" guidance

## Close

Short:
- "Rest."
- "Tomorrow: [their next thing if set]"
- Connect to mission if deep enough

## Capture

If they said something important, quote it:
> 'exact words'

Ask: "Want me to save that to the About Me section?"
