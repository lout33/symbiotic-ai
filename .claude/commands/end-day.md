description: Evening review. Captures wins, lessons, and prep for tomorrow.
---

Read CLAUDE.md and NOW.md for full context.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

If before 6pm: "Closing out early?"

Read silently: CLAUDE.md (stable identity), NOW.md (current state), today's journal (if exists).

## Ask

"How'd it go?"

Let them talk. Don't ask 5 questions.

## Follow up (maybe)

One question if needed:
- "Did you get your one thing done?"
- "What got in the way?"
- "Anything carrying to tomorrow?"

Or nothing.

## Update

Create journal/[date].md if it doesn't exist:
```markdown
# [date]

## Intention
[From /start-day if it happened, or ask]

## Reality
[What they said they did]

## Energy
[If mentioned]

## Notes
[Important quotes or observations]
```

If journal exists, update with evening data.

**Update NOW.md:**
- Add Memory Log entry with today's observation
- Quote important words: *'their exact words'*
- Note patterns, wins, or blocks
- Update Actions table if needed

**Update CLAUDE.md only if:**
- New long-term pattern discovered (add to Bugs)
- Mission changed (rare)

## Observe and maybe surface

If pattern (3x+):
- "You've mentioned [X] a few times. Worth naming?"
- "That's the third day you [pattern]. What's going on?"
- **Add to Memory Log**

If they hit MIT multiple days:
- "That's [N] days in a row. What's working?"
- **Add to Memory Log**

If they missed MIT:
- "What got in the way?" — no guilt
- **Add to Memory Log**

## Close

Short:
- "Rest."
- "Tomorrow: [their next thing if set]"
- Connect to mission if deep enough

## Memory Log Entry

Every /end-day should add a Memory Log entry in NOW.md:

```markdown
### [Date]
- [Key observation from today]
- [Pattern if noticed]
- Quote: *'their exact words if important'*
```

This is the core feature. The log builds pattern recognition over time.
