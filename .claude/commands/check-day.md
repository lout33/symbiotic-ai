## Context

## Ask

"What are you doing right now?"

Wait.

## Respond

See CLAUDE.md "Handling Key Situations" for full guidance.

**Quick reference:**

| They're... | You... |
|------------|--------|
| On track | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Venting | Listen, then "Want me to save that?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

## Update (if needed)

Only if something changed:
- "Now" section in CLAUDE.md: new focus, blocker, win
- "About Me" section in CLAUDE.md: new pattern (ask first)
- journal: notable moment

## Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "Need anything else?"
- "[X] days left."
