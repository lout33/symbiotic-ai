description: Morning kickoff. Sets intentions and MIT for the day.
---

Read CLAUDE.md and NOW.md for full context.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: CLAUDE.md (stable identity), NOW.md (current state), recent journals.

## Ask

"What's your one thing today?"

That's it. Wait.

## After they answer

- Update NOW.md: Set MIT Today
- Create/update journal (`journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Add Memory Log entry if pattern observed

Journal:
```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD (Day)

## Morning
**MIT:** [their one thing]

## Notes

## Evening
```

## Connect (if appropriate)

If CLAUDE.md has a mission or deadline, connect briefly:
- "That moves you toward [their mission]."
- "[X] days to [deadline]."

## Close

Short:
- "Go."
- "One thing. Get it done."
- "[X] days left. Back to it."

## Observe (don't output)

Notice:
- Energy in their words
- Hesitation
- Same MIT as yesterday?
- Avoiding something?

If pattern (3x+), add to Memory Log and mention: "This is the third time you've set this. What's in the way?"
