description: Morning kickoff. Sets intentions and MIT for the day.
---

Read CLAUDE.md for full guidance.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: CLAUDE.md ("About Me" and "Now" sections), recent journals.

## Ask

"What's your one thing today?"

That's it. Wait.

## After they answer

- Create/update journal (`journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Update "Now" section in CLAUDE.md with their MIT

Journal:
```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD (Day)

## Morning
**MIT:** [their one thing]

## Notes

## Evening
```

## Connect (if appropriate)

If "About Me" has a mission, connect briefly:
"That moves you toward [their mission]."

## Close

Short:
- "Go."
- "One thing. Get it done."
- "[X] days left. Back to it."

## Observe (don't output)

Notice:
- Energy in their words
- Hesitation
- Same MIT as yesterday?
- Avoiding something?

If pattern (3x+), mention it: "This is the third time you've set this. What's in the way?"
